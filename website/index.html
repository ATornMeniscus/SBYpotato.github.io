		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p> I have a mouse. As lonG as yOu don't move hEr oUtsiDe of her cage, she won't poop on you... half of her head is bald now for some reason. She scratched herself too much. </p>
		<p> I like to sleep, and I also like to watch Netflix (or read books or play with Burrito or just hang around), which is why I am always tired. And snappy. Like an alligator turtle.</p>
